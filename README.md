# Chess BOT

The project aims to serve as both a practical demonstration of AI principles and a learning resource for those interested in chess programming and AI techniques.

## How to Play

Visit the [Website](https://chess-bot-mocha.vercel.app/) to start a game against the AI.

Make your moves on the virtual chessboard by dragging and dropping pieces.

ChessBot will analyze the position and respond with its best move.
